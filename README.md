# Netflix Analyzer

## Description

Have you ever wondered, which movies, series or other shows are available in your country? - Me too!
Due to a VPN connection you can change your virtual location in another country. As a result, you have access to the Netflix data in this country.
Not every country has the same content available and some movies or series are available in other countries, instead of yours.

With this project, I wanted to get the information from several different countries via requests. Then, I can parse the html code and get the information, that I want.
If I run the code, with different countries via a VPN, I will get all the data from different countries.
Then I can compare the data and see, which movies and series are available in other countries.

I hope, you get the idea :)

## In Process

I just started the project and wanted to see, how difficult it can be. Let's see, where this project is leading me to.
I am open for tips and other hints.

## Virtual environment "pipenv"

I use pipenv as a virtual environment. Therefore you won't need to install all packages to try this code out.
